        "habitats": {"Aquariums": 5, "Cat Trees": 8, "Dog Beds": 7}
    },
}
```

### Task 1

Your task is to **dynamically** update the quantity of a supply item after a sale.

Request as much information from the user in order to know what product is to be sold.

Print out your inventory after each sale.

### Task 2

Create a shopping list of supplies that are low in stock (fewer than 10)

### Task 3

Find which animal type has the most variety. Variety in this case means the animal with the most headcount and number of breeds.

## 2. Working with COVID-19 Data

Using the provided COVID-19 sample data, attempt the following tasks:

- Find the country with the highest number of active cases
- Calculate the ratio of active cases to population for each country
- Find the country with the highest recovery rate (recoveries/total_cases)
- Calculate active cases as a percentage of population for each country
- Generate a new dictionary showing which countries have more than 20,000 active cases
- Calculate the total number of active cases across all countries
- Add a new key called "cases_per_million" to each country based on total_cases
- Using user input, update the active cases for a specific country and recalculate the global total
- Calculate what percentage of global active cases each country represents. Represent the result as a dictionary.

The COVID-19 sample data should be copied and pasted into your code file as a dictionary.
